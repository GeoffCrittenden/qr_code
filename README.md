The purpose of this app is to create a single-source way for customers to order their meals at fast-food rstaurants in a quick and error-free way.

The idea behind this app is that QR codes can generate an almost infinite number of combinations of strings, and that one single app could handle the meal ordering duties of many restaurants.
Each individual restaurant would have a QR code reader at the entrance or desired point-of-sale, and the customer's meal would be queued immediately, without any potential errors that may arise from the human-to-human interaction of traditional fast-food ordering.
